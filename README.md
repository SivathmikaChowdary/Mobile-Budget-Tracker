# Mobile-Budget-Tracker
A smart and minimal Budget &amp; Expense Tracker built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js. It lets users log in, add income and expenses, view remaining budget, and visualize data with a pie chart. Expenses are stored in localStorage, each with a consistent color. You can also export data as CSV or print a clean summary.
